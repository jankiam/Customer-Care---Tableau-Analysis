**Company Name:** **Google Fiber**

**About Company:** Google Fiber provides people and businesses with fiber optic internet.  

**Business Problem:** Understand repeat calls trend and improve overall customer experience

**Project Goal:**  

• Understand how often customers are calling customer support after their first inquiry; this will help leaders understand how effectively the team is able to answer customer questions the first time   

• Provide insights into the types of customer issues that seem to generate more repeat calls  

• Explore repeat caller trends in the three different market cities  

• Design charts so that stakeholders can view trends by week, month, quarter, and year.   

**Project background:**

The team needs to understand how often customers  phone customer support again after their first inquiry; this will help leaders understand whether the team is able to answer customer questions the first time. Further, leaders want to explore trends in repeat calls to identify why customers are having to call more than once, as well as how to improve the overall customer experience. 

**About Dataset:** This fictional dataset is a version of actual data the team works with. Because of this, the data is already anonymized and approved. It includes:

Number of calls

Number of repeat calls after first contact

Call type

Market city

Date

**Stakeholders:**

Emma Santiago, Hiring Manager

Keith Portone, Project Manager

Minna Rah, Lead BI Analyst

Team members: 

Ian Ortega, BI Analyst

Sylvie Essa, BI Analyst

Primary contacts are Emma and Keith  

**Measure success:**

The team’s ultimate goal is to reduce call volume by increasing customer satisfaction and improving operational optimization. My dashboard should demonstrate an understanding of this goal and provide stakeholders with insights about repeat caller volumes in different markets and the types of problems they represent. 

**Other considerations:**

In order to anonymize and fictionalize the data, the datasets the columns market_1, market_2, and market_3 to indicate three different city service areas the data represents. 

The data also lists five problem types:

Type_1 is account management

Type_2 is technician troubleshooting

Type_3 is scheduling

Type_4 is construction

Type_5 is internet and wifi

Additionally, the dataset records repeat calls over seven-day periods. i.e. Day 0 is orginal inquiry call and day 1 , day 2 etc are repeat call information.  

**Questions:**

How often does the customer service team receive repeat calls from customers?

What problem types generate the most repeat calls?

Which market city’s customer service team receives the most repeat calls?  

**The deliverables and metrics:**

A chart or table measuring repeat calls by their first contact date

A chart or table exploring repeat calls by market and problem type

Charts showcasing repeat calls by week, month, and quarter
